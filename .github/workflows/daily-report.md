# Daily repository activity report

Generate a concise daily report (issues and pull requests) for the repository. Use the sanitized activation text if available: "${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}".

Tasks:

1. List open issues created or updated in the last 24 hours with title, number, labels, and a short summary of activity (comments count, assignee).
2. List open pull requests created or updated in the last 24 hours with title, number, author, review status (approved/changes requested/pending), and latest commit summary.
3. Provide counts: new issues, updated issues, new PRs, updated PRs, open/closed counts.
4. Highlight any PRs with failing checks or merge conflicts.
5. Suggest top 3 PRs or issues to prioritize.
6. Create a GitHub Discussion with the report: include a concise title and the full report body using the safe output create discussion tool.

Formatting:

-   Keep the report under 800 words.
-   Provide bullet lists and short summaries.
